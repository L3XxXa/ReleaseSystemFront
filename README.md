## Description
Release system simplifies the release process. With its help, you can create releases, track them either using the client or via messenger (we used Slack during development and testing), change release dates, and cancel them. There is integration with the task tracker (we used Jira) and the automatic testing system (the coverage of autotests and their success is checked). At the same time, you can connect absolutely any messenger and task tracker.
